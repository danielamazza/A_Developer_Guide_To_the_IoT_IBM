# Rapid application development in the cloud

An Internet of Things solution usually requires a back-end server to receive and process data coming from sensors. Cloud platforms allow new solutions to be created and deployed very rapidly without having to worry about how to host the application. This series of lessons introduces you to a cloud based Platform as a Service and an open source rapid application development environment called NodeRED.

## Learning Objectives

Describe a number of cloud computing solutions and their benefits
Summarize what comprises an IoT solution
Describe the benefits of rapid application development through NodeRED
Demonstrate basic understanding of NodeRED flows by creating working flows as part of a cloud app
Demonstrate how you can use NodeRED nodes such as input, output, function and template nodes, and combine them with flow logic, to create IoT solutions (such as one with simple web services)

# Rapid application development on a Raspberry Pi

This unit looks at how to add a device to your solution. Creating an application on a Raspberry Pi and establishing secure, trusted communication between your cloud application and devices.

### Learning Objectives

* Describe value of the Internet of Things Platform service
* Describe how device types, application types, and gateway devices can communicate with the platform and each other
* Demonstrate how you can securely connect an application, device or gateway to an organization, and publish data
* Describe how you can bind a cloud application that is running on bluemix, to a service where devices are registered
* Demonstrate how data can be received at a gateway and send to a cloud app
* Demonstrate how data can be received by a cloud app, analyzed, and a command sent back to the correct device or gateway

## Programming resources

For information about installing Node.js, including the download links, follow this link : [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

The latest version of Node.js is available at [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). You should use the latest stable version (currently v4.5.0 LTS)

[https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org) is a good place for all things python - remember this course is using python 2.7 for all assignments. You don't need to install python on your computer, and python will exist on your Raspberry Pi once it is configured.

IBM Watson IoT Platform documentation is available at [https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/index.html](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/index.html)

NodeRED documentation is available at [http://nodered.org/docs/](http://nodered.org/docs/)

If you need a resource to help with JavaScript then this site [http://www.w3schools.com/js/](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) is a good reference. Previous learners also suggested the following sites for week 4 assignment assistance if not too familiar with JavaScript:

* [http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-variable-scope-and-hoisting-explained/](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-variable-scope-and-hoisting-explained/)
* [http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)

For MQTT a good place to start is the MQTT primary site : [http://mqtt.org/documentation](http://mqtt.org/documentation) or the eclipse implementation of the client in the paho project [http://www.eclipse.org/paho/](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/)

## IBM Bluemix resources

IBM Bluemix can be found here [https://www.bluemix.net](https://www.bluemix.net) and information about CloudFoundry, the Open Source technology that the Bluemix Platform as a Service functionality is built on, can be found here [http://docs.cloudfoundry.org](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org)

The CloudFoundry Command Line Interface tool (cf) is available from [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases). NOTE: This needs to run from your PC or laptop as there is not a version available that can run on the Raspberry Pi

## Raspberry Pi resources

Element14 IoT learner kit : [https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit](https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit)

You can find out about the Raspberry Pi and the senseHAT from the foundation pages [https://www.raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org) including the documentation [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/) where you will find help on getting setup and connected.

The SenseHAT Python API is documented on this site [http://pythonhosted.org/sense-hat/](http://pythonhosted.org/sense-hat/)

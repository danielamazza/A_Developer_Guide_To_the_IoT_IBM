Cloud platforms allow new solutions to be created and deployed very rapidly without having to worry about how to host the application. This series of lessons introduces you to a cloud based Platform as a Service and an open source rapid application development environment called NodeRED.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\nDescribe a number of cloud computing solutions and their benefits\nSummarize what comprises an IoT solution\nDescribe the benefits of rapid application development through NodeRED\nDemonstrate basic understanding of NodeRED flows by creating working flows as part of a cloud app\nDemonstrate how you can use NodeRED nodes such as input, output, function and template nodes, and combine them with flow logic, to create IoT solutions (such as one with simple web services)\n\n\nIntroduction to a Platform as a Service - IBM Bluemix\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to IBM Bluemix - Agenda (27 sec)\n\n\nOverview of Cloud Computing3 min\n\n\nWhat is IBM Bluemix?4 min\n\n\nCreate an IBM Bluemix account52 sec\n\n\nA tour of IBM Bluemix7 min\n\n\nIBM Bluemix Summary35 sec\n\n\nLearning module summary: Introduction to Platform as a Service - * IBM Bluemix10 min\n\n\n\n\nRapid application development for Internet of Things\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to NodeRED - 1 (9 min)\n\n\nDeploy NodeRED to Bluemix using a Boilerplate - step by step (10 min)\n\n\nIntroduction to NodeRED - 2 (5 min)\n\n\nAdding a new node - step by step (10 min)\n\n\nLearning module summary: Rapid application development for Internet of Things (10 min)\n\n\n\n\nNodeRED function node\n\n\n\n\nThe NodeRED Function node part (16 min)\n\n\nFunction node - step by step (10 min)\n\n\nThe NodeRED Function node part 2 (6 min)\n\n\nThe NodeRED Function node part 3 (5 min)\n\n\nMaking packages available to the function node - step by step (10 min)\n\n\nQuiz: Using the function node (5 questions)\n\n\nSubmitting your first assignment (10 min)\n\n\nProgramming Assignment: Your First NodeRED application (45 min)\n\n\nLearning module summary: NodeRED function node (10 min)\n\n\n\n\nAdditional NodeRED nodes\n\n\n\n\nNodeRED Additional node part 1 (6 min)\n\n\nNodeRED Additional node part 2 (6 min)\n\n\nTemplate node sample flow (10 min)\n\n\nNodeRED Additional node part 3 (6 min)\n\n\nControlling a node using input data (10 min)\n\n\nNodeRED Additional node part 4 (6 min)\n\n\nProgramming Assignment: NodeRED application (1h)\n\n\nLearning module summary: Additional NodeRED nodes (10 min)",
